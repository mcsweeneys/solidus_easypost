Work in Progress
================

This gem is under heavy development. Stand by!


Active Shipping / EasyPost Bridge
=================================

ActiveShipping is a complex and deprecated plugin for Solidus that calculates shipping rates. This Gem is intended to be a drop-in
replacement, swapping ActiveShipping out for EasyPost in the backend.

This simplifies this plugin quite a bit. All you need to do is set up an EasyPost account, configure "Easypost api key" under Active Shipping Settings, and you should
be ready to go!
